# VK Video Timeline Hopper

Chrome extension for VK Video that copies movement along the timeline of a niche video hosting site called Youtube. During testing, an unforgivable number of videos from this platform were watched, and Anton Shastun began to feel like part of the development team. The extension adds movement between timecodes (if any) and ten equal parts of the video.
